The project aims at addressing the issues faced by the farmers in plucking arecanuts and spraying pesticides in the tree. These issues can be solved by a machine which can climb a tree without(automatic) or with (semi-automatic) the help of a man.
A tree climbing machine which can climb the tree automatically and spray pesticides with the help of a man who will control the sprayer setup on the ground has been developed. This machine needs a battery for its operation and can climb tree in approximately 10 feet per minute.
